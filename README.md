# HMM Part-of-Speech Tagging Assignment

This repository contains the code and documentation for an assignment that provides hands-on experience in using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for part-of-speech tagging. In this assignment, we utilize the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank dataset to construct an HMM model for part-of-speech tagging. Notably, the HMM model is implemented using two methods: Greedy Decoding and Viterbi Decoding.

## Assignment Overview

The key objectives of this assignment are as follows:

1. **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** Gain practical knowledge of Hidden Markov Models and their application in part-of-speech tagging tasks.

2. **Data Preparation:** Preprocess the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank dataset to extract the necessary information for building and training the HMM model.

3. **Model Implementation:** Implement the HMM model for part-of-speech tagging using two distinct methods: Greedy Decoding and Viterbi Decoding.

4. **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of both decoding methods and compare their results in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
